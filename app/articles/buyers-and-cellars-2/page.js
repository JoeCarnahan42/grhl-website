          Welcome back! It&apos;s time to check in on the early trade
          predictions that were made. Last time it was first to worst starting
          with the Lincoln Division. Due to lack of efforts and I ran out of
          nice things to say about the bottom dwellers we will go from the
          bottom to the top. Sorry Raptors, but at least you are above ground
          and fighting extinction again.

          1 st up, the Raptors. Let me start by apologizing for putting your
          players on every team&apos;s wish list. I didn&apos;t notice I did
          that. It should show you that you have talent to work with there. Now,
          we&apos;ve found the 3rd captain! I&apos;m still not saying who it was
          though, use this info as fuel for your fire to finish the season
          strong. There seems to be fewer negative emotions or maybe it&apos;s
          not perceived as negative emotions now. Shout out to RP for keeping
          your head up and giving your team a chance! They are close to piecing
          this together and being able to make a playoff Run. They have too much
          depth to be a winless team. On to the trade side of things. Sit down
          and hold on for this one. Raptors are using Berkman like the T-cats
          did with Payne. Sometimes it just doesn&apos;t work. Find a new role
          for him or ship him out. Bring in something new. It&apos;s a small
          market for big names right now. But that&apos;s a name that can get
          you something in return. Trouble is he only holds value for this
          season, (going back to the draft) so he will have to go to a team
          that&apos;s looking to make a run this year.

          2 nd , the yeti&apos;s get Stubby and Loehr back this next game. This
          should allow them to win some of those close games. Theres still a
          chance to sneak into a bottom playoff spot. With Jackson and Griffin
          anchoring down the defense in front of Stubby, adding a good two-way
          player might get you back on track as well. Adding a depth player who
          helps your tier 4 and tier 5 players stand out could go a long way
          also. This team should not be winless after looking at their roster.
          Let&apos;s look at who they should move. He&apos;s a good player but I
          don&apos;t think his style fits here. Gehrig could be shopped to a
          team that plays gritty hockey or needs that energy. It&apos;s not easy
          trading someone who brings multiple levels to the game but if their
          style doesn&apos;t fit its time to move on. Ask the Thunder cats and
          possibly the Raptors soon...

          Up next, Venom. Sneaking out a couple wins since the last article. Did
          they finally start to gel. Maybe the teams they played are having a
          bit of an identity crisis. Either way good for them. this only helps
          their trade value. Raising the question, are they buying now? And who
          do they move if they need that one piece to set them over the top. The
          top guys here need to find a way to get the tier 4 and 5 involved.
          Pipas should have more than 0 points. He can skate and has a decent
          shot. I know, sometimes its tricky for him to get over the boards when
          his shift is over, but still, somebody help this guy get some points.
          If not, moving Stradtmann or Lucas is what I would watch for. Theres
          just a small market for what they have to offer. I&apos;m curious to
          see how they play in front of Hart once he returns. Is a goalie trade
          still on the table?

          4 TH this time. but don&apos;t let it fool ya. Remember, reversed the
          order this time so I will say nice things about the Cellars. One win
          and one loss since the last article. A loss to the Outlaws and a win
          over the Raptors. Nothing has really changed here. You won the game
          you should have won and struggled to figure out the Outlaws. I still
          think this is a fundamentally sound team. I know its not their style
          but maybe what they are missing is that WOW factor. There is plenty of
          talent out there that is becoming available or will be soon. I just
          don&apos;t know who they trade to get that piece. I do think to get a
          big name you have to give up a big name. Aside from captains $14 is
          the highest cap spent on a player. The difference is 1 contract year.
          Haselhorst can be resigned, T. Duffin must enter the draft. Watch for
          one of these guys to move.

          Finally, for the Show-me division, the Jets. Who also went 1 â€“ 1 since
          the last article. Beating a team that they should beat in the
          Yeti&apos;s. While putting up one hell of a fight against the Wolves.
          Quinn likes the guys who are coachable and listens to him as he knows
          how to win. Except for Combs, he doesn&apos;t listen to Quinn at all.
          Sometimes it feels like he says the opposite just to keep Quinn on his
          toes. Combs is probably ready to go with the opposite of whatever I
          write in this article. He makes the league more fun though. Anyway,
          the Jets are already in the mix of top teams, and Quinn already has
          the avengers assembled. So, who comes out wand what do they need? I
          think they must move a middle of the pack member for something over
          the top. A three-way trade and multiple pieces could happen for this
          team. Names like Kelly and Olbrich are my first thoughts. You might
          even see Wolves Legend Matt Lesko on the trade block.

          When you look at the Moose, its hard understand how they do not have a
          better record. Theres&apos;s talent up and down the line up. A pretty
          good core group of guys that all went to the same school. Costillo and
          Lyons paired up together has always been something fun to watch. Its
          possible the individual efforts need to become more of a team game. I
          don&apos;t think they stay at the bottom of this division for long if
          they start playing like a team. Find a way to incorporate the lower
          tier guys. The goalie has just as many points as half of your team.
          Some of the lower point guys are defense so little to no points are
          expected. Once that issue gets figured out playing these guys will be
          even more difficult. Williams, Sotnyk, or Heatherly could find
          themselves in a different jersey before the Season is over.

          Raptors. They play to their competition instead of putting games away.
          Trying to relax with a lead has almost cost them a couple of times

          ever they trade with for next year. Maybe some future considerations,
          cap, or contract years at the draft.

          The 3 rd team we will talk about in the Lincoln division Outlaws.
          Going 1-1 in the last 2 games and putting their overall record at 3-2.
          Should have been 4-1 if not for that HUGE upset at the HFC night. Ya
          can&apos;t win them all, am I right? Still, a solid, young team that
          will skate circles around most teams they play. It seems to be
          affective for the most part. What are they missing this year? Is it a
          true defenseman? Or a high-end scorer? They lost both this year. In
          order to fill those holes you would have to be willing to move a
          middle tier guy. I think they can do one but not both. Trade Meagher
          for more defense or trade Gruebner for more offense. Maybe I&apos;m
          looking at that backwards? I think you have a better chance of getting
          a goal scorer from someone who has too much defense or getting a
          better defense man from someone who needs that scoring ability.

          4 th on this list. Wolves. Still waiting for an entire roster to be
          there. It&apos;s happened twice in two years. Life is busy for
          everyone, so I understand. They have scoring. They have defense. It
          seems shaky at times, but I think they are using the regular season to
          gauge what they can do with who they have and who they can move where.
          Its better to do that early when you still have time to recover if it
          doesn&apos;t work. Look for these guys to go for a defense man.
          Somewhere around the middle of the pack a nice tier 3 or low 2 if the
          stars can align. Might also be a captain trade if Amato misses another
          on a no call no show. If you can&apos;t find an ideal trade for Amato
          now who can they move? Rick is making a splash on the stat sheet so
          that adds some pressure to the Wolves former goal leader (Yeargain.)
          He does have a two-year deal that is cap friendly!

          without a big moment in the game. A strong penalty kill, a power play
          goal, something to swing the momentum. Maybe that&apos;s just how they
          approached our team. It was working well for them. until it
          didn&apos;tâ€¦ I think they&apos;ve only been stopped on the powerplay
          one time this year also. Up until the last game their PK was
          phenomenal as well. So what are they looking for? In my opinion, stay
          out of the box. This unit works best as a whole. Estes is a lock down
          defender but at his level maybe a few more points would help. Utilize
          that third line! Any trade they make would be lateral for how good
          their roster is already. Maybe there&apos;s a sleeper trade out there
          that I don&apos;t see. aside from changing the identity of the team
          and going heavy offense move one of the guys that I like to call
          quarterbacks. Theres a few teams that need one.
